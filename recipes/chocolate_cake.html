    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>With a unique twist on the favorite chocolate zucchini cake, this recipe adds an attractive swirl of cream cheese that will have everyone asking for more. This cake can easily have other variations. I have made it without the cream cheese swirl/chips topping and have frosted the cake. I have also added other topping such as coconut, nuts, and caramel. You are limited only by your imagination. </p>
